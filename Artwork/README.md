This folder contains assets for making cover art for use in game launchers, emulators, YouTube videos, and mock-up packaging. Add the images as layers to whatever template is appropriate for your target platform or medium.

The main background and decorative palms for Aesthetic Edition were generated with Microsoft Bing Image Creator and edited extensively. These particular images are not eligible for copyright and I do not claim ownership of them. I normally wouldn't use generative AI, but vaporwave is already plunder and remix, and the artist denied an opportunity to create the images is myself, so I don't really feel bad about it in this case.

All other images in the folder are my own work from scratch.
