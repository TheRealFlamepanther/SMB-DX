The key image and decorative palm for Aesthetic Edition were generated with Microsoft Bing Image Creator. Despite some editing on my part, these two particular images are not eligible for copyright and I do not claim ownership of them. I normally wouldn't use generative AI, but vaporwave is already plunder and remix, and the only artist denied an opportunity to create the images is myself, so I don't really feel bad about it in this case.

All other images in the folder are my own work from scratch.
