These patches should be applied to a ROM that has already been patched with the main SMBDX 4.6 ips patch.

Patches with a ! at the beginning of the file name have minor negative side effects due to limitations of the game. Most of the patches here will stack just fine with each other, except for some of the aforementioned ! patches and any others that are obviously contradictory. Feel free to experiment and create your own custom DX experience! You could apply all of the SMB3 style patches together, for example.

Many of these patches will not work with the vaporwave or PAL versions. Sorry!
