These patches should be applied to a ROM that has already been patched with the main SMBDX 4.6 ips patch.
Most of them will stack just fine with each other, except where noted with a ! in the file name.
Feel free to experiment and create your own custom DX experience!  

Some of these will not work with the vaporwave or PAL versions. Sorry!
