This is a repository for the family of NES Super Mario Bros ROM hacks collectively known as Super Mario Bros DX (or sometimes just Mario DX). This is a "facelift" project that started in or around 1997. It should not be confused with Super Mario Bros Deluxe for Game Boy Color. It has no relation to the Flash animation series, Super Mario World hack, New Super Mario Bros Wii hack, or PC fan game that have shared the same name, nor to various other Super Mario Bros hacks with "DX" in their titles. This particular "Super Mario Bros DX" makes no special claim the name, but it holds the distinction of being the first, predating all of the others, including the Game Boy Color game.

The primary aim of the project is (and has always been) to make the original Super Mario Bros for NES look more modern and appealing and bring it more in line with later games in the series. The project aims to do this without changing the size of the ROM or doing anything likely to break compatibility with simple, non-graphical patches for Super Mario Bros, e.g. level-only hacks, the Spiny egg fix, SMB3 US style damage, etc. 

The main patch is considered complete as of December 2024, approximately 25 years after version 1.0 was first published. Add-ons, variants, and spinoff projects will continue indefinitely as time and interest permit.
